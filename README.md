# Iris-flower-classification

## Introduction
This project is about classifying iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The classification is based on the length and width of the sepals and petals of the flowers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous [Iris Flower Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 150 samples with four features each:
 sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/13Gitanjali/iris-classification.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd iris-classification`
3. Run the script: `python iris_classification.py`

## Results
The results, including the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix, will be printed in the console.
